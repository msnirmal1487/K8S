docker run ubuntu ## it runs an instance of ubuntu image and exits immediately
## containers are ment to run a specific task or process (say host a web server/app server/DB). they are not ment host a OS
## if the process is stopped/fails the containers life cycle ends
docker run ubuntu [COMMAND] ## COMMAND (Command line) Overrides the the default comand in the Dockerfile of ubuntu
docker run ubuntu sleep 5 ## it sleeps for 5 seconds

##to make the chnge to add the sleep command permanent we need to create a docker image that has teh sleep command in the Dockerfile. 

```
FROM ubuntu
CMD sleep 5  ## CMD command param1 / CMD ["command", "param1"] (in this JSON format the first element in the array should be an executable.)
```

docker build -t ubuntu-sleeper:myTag . ## in -t text after : is TAG (optional value)
docker run ubuntu-sleeper:myTag ## cintainer runs for 5 seconds and then exits. 
docker run ubuntu-sleeper sleep 100 ## overiding the command in the image and asking it sleep for 100s. 
##not soo friendly and defeats the purpose of creating the image

## Alternatively use ENTRYPOINT instead of CMD while building the image.  

```
FROM ubuntu
ENTRYPOINT ["sleep"]   ## in the ENTRYPOINT instruction we can specify the program when to run when the container starts. 
```

docker build -t ubuntu-sleeper-param:myTag .
docker build -t ubuntu-sleeper-param 10 ## whatever param (10) we pass in the command line for `docker run` will be appended to the command in ENTRPOINT instruction

## if we misss to pass the parameter, the docker run will fail with error parameter missing.  

```
FROM ubuntu
ENTRYPOINT ["sleep"]   ## in the ENTRYPOINT instruction we can specify the program when to run when the container starts. 
CMD ["5"] ## pass default param value, which will be used if we do not override the parameter in docker run command

## Both ENTRYPOINT and CMD instructions should be in JSON format
```
docker run ubuntu-sleeper-param:myTag 1000
docker run ubuntu-sleeper-param:myTag # no param passed, uses the default value 5 in image
docker run --entrypoint sleep2.0 ubuntu-sleeper-param:myTag 500 ## to override the ENTRYPOINT command in image
docker ps ## list the containers (running)
docker ps -a ## list the containers (running and exited)
